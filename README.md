# Rhino-VR
This repository hosts all the video simulations demonstrating the functionalities of the Rhino VR plugin within the Unity environment. The project is focused on integrating Rhino's powerful 3D modeling capabilities with the immersive experience of virtual reality in Unity.

# Project Overview
The Rhino VR plugin aims to bring together Rhino’s advanced design tools and Unity’s interactive VR capabilities, allowing users to:

Visualize and interact with complex 3D models in a virtual reality setting.
Simulate real-time changes and interactions with Rhino models directly in Unity.
Explore design possibilities in an immersive environment that enhances spatial understanding and decision-making.

# Content
This repository contains a series of video simulations that showcase:

Key features of the Rhino VR plugin.
Step-by-step demonstrations of different functionalities within Unity.
Use cases highlighting how the integration can be utilized in real-world scenarios.
Each video is designed to provide a clear understanding of how the plugin operates and the potential it holds for designers, architects, and developers working in the field of 3D modeling and VR.

# Usage
Feel free to explore the videos to get insights into the plugin's capabilities. For those interested in the technical details or in contributing to the project, please refer to the main code repository [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1dvyUFiwMuhgVZudEV7qf73dHN3fY7AeW?usp=drive_link).
